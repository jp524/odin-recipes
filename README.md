# Odin Recipes

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum.

This is a HTML website showcasing three of my favourite recipes. Each recipe page contains a picture of the dish, as well as ingredients and instructions.

Information is organized using different level headings, unordered lists and ordered lists.

Navigation between the main page and recipes pages is possible.
